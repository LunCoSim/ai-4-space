**Welcome to the starting point of your lunar mission.**

## How to use this repository
This repository is designed to help you—regardless of your technical background—create a realistic lunar base simulation using AI tools.

### Step 1: Learn the Basics
If you are new here, read these guides first:
- [Introduction](guides/INTRODUCTION.MD): What is this project and who is it for?
- [Tools & Services](guides/TOOLS_AND_SERVICES.MD): Understanding LunCoSim, Godot, and AI Editors.
- [Using Workspaces](guides/USING_WORKSPACES.MD): How to work with multiple repositories in one project.

### Step 2: Start Building (The Prompt)
Copy the text below and paste it into your favorite AI tool (Antigravity, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). This prompt gives the AI the context it needs to help you build.

```text
I want to design a realistic lunar base simulation. I have no programming background, but I want to use the LunCoSim framework (built on Godot).

Please help me:
1. Understand the basics of a lunar base (power, life support, habitats).
2. Create a step-by-step plan to build my base using LunCoSim.
3. Guide me through using AI-native code editors to implement my ideas in the simulator.
