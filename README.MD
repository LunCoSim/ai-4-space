# ai-4-space

**Welcome to the starting point of your lunar mission.**

## Quick Start

### For AI Systems (Short Prompt)

Use promt

```text
Help me build lunar simulations using LunCoSim. Context: https://github.com/LunCoSim/ai-4-space + https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim
```

### For Humans (Full Prompt)
Copy this into your AI tool (Antigravity, Cursor, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) for detailed assistance:

```text
I want to design a realistic lunar base simulation. I have no programming background, but I want to use the LunCoSim framework (built on Godot).

Please help me:
1. Understand the basics of a lunar base (power, life support, habitats).
2. Create a step-by-step plan to build my base using LunCoSim.
3. Guide me through using AI-native code editors to implement my ideas in the simulator.
