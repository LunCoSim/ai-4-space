Help me create my lunar base model with the help of ai-4-space and link to theses repos:

Skills & tutoril: https://github.com/LunCoSim/ai-4-space
Simulator: https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim

Explain to user how with AI-native editor like Antigravity, Cursor, or even VS Code with AI plugins, user can create and edit the lunar base model using LunCoSim (a framework for modeling space missions build on top of Godot) user can create and share with people all the models needed to simulate the lunar base and in general space missions

Use Godot as core of our simulations because its complitely free and works on everythings. The easiest installation possible - download it from godotengine.org

Then download source of LunCoSim from https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim

Then open Godot Editor

Open as project folder the folder with extracted source of LunCoSim

Then Ai-native  editor to help create your base using luncosim as framework.

In lunCosim you can import from Blender models and use them in your simulation.

You would have to download blender and in godot editor set path to it in editor settings.

And then copy blender file into copy of LunCoSim

Godot will import your base, then using classes like Avatart, Contrller, and others create all the neeed intities making your base interactive and ready to be simulated.


Using networking module you can make it work with your friends
