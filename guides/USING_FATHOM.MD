# Using Fathom to Record Meetings

## What is Fathom?
**Fathom** is an AI-powered meeting assistant that automatically records, transcribes, and summarizes your online meetings. Think of it as a smart note-taker that never misses a detail.

## Why Use Fathom for LunCoSim Projects?
When working on lunar base designs or space mission scenarios, you'll have many discussions with team members, stakeholders, or collaborators. Fathom helps by:
- **Capturing every detail**: Never lose important technical specifications or design decisions
- **Creating searchable transcripts**: Find that conversation about solar panel placement from three weeks ago
- **Generating summaries**: Get the key points without rewatching the entire meeting
- **Sharing knowledge**: Team members who missed the meeting can catch up quickly

* Share transcripts with team members who need to implement the designs

### For Stakeholder Presentations
* Use summaries to create follow-up emails
* Extract action items to track commitments
* Keep a record of feedback and requirements

### For Technical Discussions
* Search transcripts for specific technical terms later
* Reference exact quotes when documenting decisions
* Create a knowledge base of design rationale

## Privacy & Permissions

* You can delete recordings at any time

## Integration with Your Workflow

* **Share clips**: Send specific moments to team members
* **Link to project docs**: Reference Fathom recordings in your GitHub issues or project plans
* **AI summaries**: Copy key points into your project notes or reports

## Tips for Maximum Value
1. **Name your meetings clearly**: Use descriptive titles like "Lunar Base Power System Review - Week 3"
2. **Review summaries promptly**: Check AI-generated summaries for accuracy while the meeting is fresh
3. **Tag and organize**: Use Fathom's tagging system to categorize meetings by project or topic
4. **Create a library**: Build a searchable archive of all project discussions
5. **Share selectively**: Only share recordings with people who need them

## Common Questions
