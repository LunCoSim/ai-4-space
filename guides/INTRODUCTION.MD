# Introduction to ai4space

## What is this?
**ai4space** is a bridge between your ideas and a living, interactive lunar simulation. 

If you have an idea for a lunar/martian base, or a general mission scenario, you should be able to build it with our help

## Who is this for?
This repository is designed for:
- **Space engineers, Visionaries, Designers**: You have the concept, ai build it for you with the skill from this repo
- **Space Enthusiasts**: You want to create a realistic "Live Interactive World" on the Moon.

## How does it work?
Traditionally, building a simulation requires learning complex programming languages and game engines. We are changing that.

By combining **LunCoSim** (our simulation platform) with **AI Agents**, we act as your technical team. 

You provide the vision and the specifications; the AI helps you implement them into the simulation.

This repository provides the "Instruction Manual" that you can feed to your AI assistant, enabling it to expert guide you through the creation process.
