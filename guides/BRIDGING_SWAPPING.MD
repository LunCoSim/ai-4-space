# 🌉 Bridging & Swapping Guide

Moving and exchanging assets between different blockchains.

## 🔀 Swapping (Same Chain)
Exchanging Token A for Token B on the same network.
- **[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)**: Standard for Ethereum and L2s.
- **[Jupiter](https://jup.ag)**: Standard for Solana.
- **[CowSwap](https://cow.fi)**: MEV-protected swaps (better prices on Ethereum).

## 🌉 Bridging (Cross-Chain)
Moving assets from Chain A to Chain B (e.g., Ethereum to Base).
- **[Jumper.exchange](https://jumper.exchange)**: Aggregates bridges and DEXs to find the cheapest/fastest route. Highly recommended.
- **[Stargate](https://stargate.finance)**: Popular for stablecoin bridging.
- **[Across](https://across.to)**: Very fast and cheap L2 to L2 bridging.

## 💡 Pro Tips
- **Approval**: Before swapping, you must "Approve" the dApp to spend your tokens.
- **Slippage**: The price change you're willing to accept. Use 0.5% for high liquidity, more for volatile tokens.
- **Gas**: Always keep a small amount of the native token (ETH, SOL, POL) to pay for the bridge/swap.
